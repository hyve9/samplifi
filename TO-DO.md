# To do:

- add spectral measures (spectral flatness, flux, centroid, snr)
- add musical measures (chatgpt suggested, for pitch, melody, harmony - maybe omit timbre since samplifi is kind of doing the opposite)
- in analysis, talk about why certain measures would work and others wouldn't - i.e. haaqi and timbre would be bad, spectral flatness would be good, why, etc.
- one actions, run once with haaqi, one with spectral, one with music - no, most computationally effective is to do it all at once and save to different files
- new functions in samplifi.py - one for spectral, one for musical
- new options in run-samplifi - score-haaqi, score-spectral, score-music [DONE]
- modularize everything in run-samplify [DONE]
